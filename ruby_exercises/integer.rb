# number = 1
# puts number

# a = 1
# puts a

# large_number = 1
# puts large_number

# apples = 1
# puts apples
# ===============
# number = 4
# number = number * 3
# puts number + 2

# Same as 

# puts 4 * 3 + 2
# ================

# # Things on the right goes first
# Ruby will first look at the expression 2 + 3 * 4, 
# which will result in the number (object) 14. She will then assign the name number to this object

# number = 2 + 3 * 4
# puts number

# number = 4 + 2 * 4
# puts number
