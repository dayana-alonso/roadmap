Inheritance 
provides the concept of “reusability”, i.e. If a programmer wants to create a new class and there is a class that already includes some of the code that programmer wants, then he or she can derive a new class from the existing class. By doing this, it increases the reuse of the fields and methods of the existing class without creating extra code.


Key terms in Inheritance:

Super class:The class whose characteristics are inherited is known as a superclass or base class or parent class.

Sub class:The class which is derived from another class is known as a subclass or derived class or child class. You can also add its own objects, methods in addition to base class methods and objects etc.
